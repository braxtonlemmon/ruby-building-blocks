The caesar cipher method takes a phrase and "encodes" the phrase by shifting
all the letters in the phrase a designated number of characters in the
alphabet. For example:
	caesar_cipher("Moon", 3)
	The method will take the word "Moon", shift each letter three characters, and
	return the word "Prrq"

RSpec tests are also included and are based on The Odin Project's section on RSpec testing:
